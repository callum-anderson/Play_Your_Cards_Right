# Play_Your_Cards_Right
A JavaScript front-end game based on the popular TV show. 

I built this game as a side-project after studying JavaScript at CodeClan (October 2018), to practice my JS and HTML/CSS/DOM skills. It's very loosely based on the TV show, and partly inspired by the late Sir Bruce Forsyth who passed last year. 

It's mobile responsive, although only tested within Chrome device mode. Everything is built using vanilla HTML/CSS/JS, including the cards which are constructed from text characters as opposed to using images of cards.
